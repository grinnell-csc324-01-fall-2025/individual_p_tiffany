## Observed Pain Points in the AI-Therapy Website (*Abby*)

During participant exploration of the AI-therapy website *Abby*, several usability issues emerged:

1. **Interface Design**  
   - The interface lacks user-friendly customization options, such as color adjustments.  
   - The default white background may feel unsettling or visually harsh for many users.  
   - In full-screen mode, large white margins create excessive empty space, which contributes to a distracting and uncomfortable user experience.  

2. **Accessibility of Tools**  
   - Key features, such as cognitive tools, are embedded under a single **“Tools”** button.  
   - This design makes it inconvenient for users who prefer quick access to a specific functionality, reducing efficiency and ease of use.  

3. **Progress Tracker**  
   - A progress tracker located on the left side displays progress in the form **“x/5”**, requiring users to send a certain number of messages to unlock features such as analysis and roadmaps.  
   - This structure creates unnecessary pressure, as it feels more like a burden than a supportive feature.  

4. **Analysis Content**  
   - Once unlocked, the analysis feature provides evaluative sum
